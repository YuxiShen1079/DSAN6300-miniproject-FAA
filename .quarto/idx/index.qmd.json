When Are the Skies Busiest?\n\n## 1.1 Flight Volume by Day of the Week\n\nTo identify weekly travel patterns, I ranked days of the week based on total flight volume.  \nA simple grouping query joined to the weekday lookup table reveals that:\n\n- **Sunday** had the highest number of flights  \n- **Monday** was the second busiest  \n- **Tuesday** had the fewest  \n\nThese results align with typical holiday-season activity: weekend travel drives up Sunday flight counts, while business travel contributes to elevated Monday volume.

Early December begins with moderate traffic, followed by a **consistent upward trend leading into the holiday period**, where flight counts peak around **December 20–23**. This aligns with pre-Christmas travel surges. After the 24th, flight volume **declines sharply**, reflecting reduced travel on Christmas Day. Traffic increases again slightly after December 26 as post-holiday travel resumes.  \n\n- These patterns reveal how strongly flight volume correlates with holiday travel behavior. Understanding these fluctuations is essential because high-volume days tend to place more pressure on airports and airlines, increasing the likelihood of delays, congestion, and operational disruptions.\n\n> **Why this matters:** Daily traffic volume is closely tied to operational delays — congestion increases the likelihood of late departures and missed connections.\n\n### Visualization\n\n- Line chart showing:\n  - Raw flight counts by day  \n  - 3-day moving average overlay\n  - weekly fluctuation of number of flights  \n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"./data/miniproject_task7_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\n\n# Convert date column to datetime\ndf2['Flightdate'] = pd.to_datetime(df2['Flightdate'])\n\n# Raw flights per day\nplt.plot(df2['Flightdate'], df2['num_flights'], label=\"Daily Flights\", linewidth=2)\n\n# 3-day moving average\nplt.plot(df2['Flightdate'], df2['avg_num_flights_3day'], \n         label=\"3-Day Moving Average\", linewidth=2.5)\n\nplt.title(\"Daily Flights and 3-Day Moving Average — December 2018\", fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel(\"Date\", fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Flights\", fontsize=12)\nplt.grid(alpha=0.3)\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n---\n\n# 2. How Bad Are Delays?\n\n## 2.1 Maximum Departure Delay by Airline\n\nI computed the **maximal departure delay** (in minutes) for each airline.\n\n- The worst delay observed was for **SkyWest Airlines Inc.**, with a flight departing **2098** late.\n- The smallest maximum delay belonged to **Alaska Airlines Inc.**.\n\nExtreme delays may be driven by severe weather or operational disruptions, but they highlight worst-case passenger experiences.\n\n### Visualization\n\n- Bar chart of **maximum delays per airline**, ordered ascending.\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task1_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\ndf[\"AirlineName\"] = df[\"AirlineName\"].str.split(\":\").str[0]\nplt.bar(df[\"AirlineName\"], df[\"MaxDepDelayMinutes\"], align='center', alpha=0.7)\nplt.xlabel(\"Airline Name\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=30, size=8)\nplt.ylabel('Time Length of Maximum Departure Delay (minutes)')\nplt.title('Maximum Delays per Airline')\n\n# Display the chart\nplt.show()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2.2 Early Departures (Negative Delays)\n\nSome airlines operate flights that leave earlier than scheduled.  \nBy examining negative `DepDelay` values:\n\n- The biggest early departure was **72 minutes early** by **United AirLines Inc.**.\n \n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task2_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\ndf[\"AirlineName\"] = df[\"AirlineName\"].str.split(\":\").str[0]\nplt.bar(df[\"AirlineName\"], df[\"MaxEarlyDepartureMin\"], align='center', alpha=0.7)\nplt.xlabel(\"Airline Name\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=30, size=8)\nplt.ylabel('Time Length of Maximum Early Departure (minutes)')\nplt.title('Maximum Early Departure per Airline')\n\n# Display the chart\nplt.show()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2.3 Which Airports Experience the Worst Delays?\n\nUsing `DepDelayMinutes`—which assigns early departures a delay of zero—I calculated the **average departure delay for each origin airport**. This measure highlights airports where operational congestion, scheduling inefficiency, or weather-related factors contribute to slower throughput.\n\n- The airport with the **highest average delay** was **Liberal, KS: Liberal Mid-America Regional**, with an average delay of **63.82 minutes**.\n\nThis result suggests that even smaller regional airports can become significant delay points, depending on local conditions and airline routing patterns.\n\n---\n\n## 2.4 For Each Airline, Which Airport Is Its Biggest Delay Problem?\n\nTo better understand how operational performance varies by airline and location, I used a window function to identify, for **each airline**, the **airport where it experiences its highest average departure delay**.\n\nA few illustrative examples include:\n\n- **Delta Air Lines Inc. (DL)** faces its longest delays at **Kalispell, MT: Glacier Park International**, averaging **60.12 minutes**.  \n- **ExpressJet Airlines LLC (EV)** experiences its worst delays at **Detroit, MI: Detroit Metro Wayne County**, with an exceptionally high average delay of **167 minutes**.  \n- **JetBlue Airways (B6)** and **Frontier Airlines (F9)** both encounter their highest delays at **Dallas/Fort Worth, TX: Dallas/Fort Worth International**, averaging approximately **50 minutes**.\n\nThese patterns reveal that **delay hotspots are airline-specific**. An airport that is highly problematic for one carrier may operate efficiently for another, underscoring the complex interactions between airline scheduling, airport capacity, and regional conditions.\n\n> **Key Insight:** Delay challenges are not uniform. Understanding the airline–airport combinations that generate the greatest delays is essential for targeted operational improvements.\n\n### Visualization\n\n- Grouped bar chart or table showing:\n  - Airline  \n  - Worst-performing airport  \n  - Average departure delay  \n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task5_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\ndf[\"airline_name\"] = df[\"airline_name\"].astype(str).str.split(\":\").str[0]\ndf = df.sort_values(\"avg_dep_delay\", ascending=True)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(\ndata=df,\nx=\"avg_dep_delay\",\ny=\"airline_name\",\nhue=\"airport_name\", # color by airport\ndodge=False # one bar per airline\n)\nplt.xlabel(\"Average Departure Delay (minutes)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Airline\")\nplt.title(\"Worst-Origin Airport for Each Airline (Average Departure Delay)\")\nplt.grid(axis=\"x\", alpha=0.3)\nplt.legend(title=\"Airport\", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=\"upper left\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n--- \n\n# 3. Why Do Flights Get Cancelled?\n\n## 3.1 Do Cancellations Occur in December 2018?\n\nYes.  \nAcross all flights in December 2018, the dataset contains **6,752 cancelled flights**, indicating that cancellations were a non-negligible operational issue during this month.\n\n---\n\n## 3.2 Most Frequent Cancellation Reasons by Airport\n\nTo understand why cancellations occur, I identified the **most common cancellation reason** at each departure airport using a window function joined with the cancellation-reason lookup table.\n\nTypical cancellation categories include:\n\n- **Weather (A)** — conditions such as snow, thunderstorms, or low visibility  \n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task6b_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\ndf2[df2[\"Reason\"] == \"Weather\"].head(10)\n```\n\n- **Carrier (B)** — airline-related operational issues, staffing shortages, or maintenance  \n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task6b_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\ndf2[df2[\"Reason\"] == \"Carrier\"].head(10)\n```\n\n- **National Air System (C)** — air-traffic control, routing restrictions, or system capacity  \n\n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task6b_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\ndf2[df2[\"Reason\"] == \"National Air System\"].head(10)\n```\n\n\n- **Security (D)** — security-related disruptions or alerts  \n\n  -- my dataset does not contain flighted cancelled due to security reasons. \n\nAcross the airports in this dataset, the **dominant cancellation reason was Carrier-related issues**. Every airport for which cancellations were recorded listed “Carrier” as its most frequent cancellation category.  \n\nThe highest counts occurred at:\n\n- **Phoenix Sky Harbor International** — 51 cancellations  \n- **Burbank Bob Hope Airport** — 34 cancellations  \n- **San Jose Mineta International Airport** — 30 cancellations  \n\nThese patterns suggest that, during December 2018, **airline-level operational disruptions**—rather than severe weather or national-system constraints—were the primary drivers of cancelled flights. This aligns with December’s heavy travel season, where tight schedules and high aircraft utilization can amplify delays and operational failures.\n\n> **Key Insight:** Cancellation patterns vary substantially by location, but in December 2018, the overwhelming majority of cancellations were due to **Carrier-related factors**, highlighting internal airline operational pressures rather than external environmental conditions.\n\n### Visualization\n\nA horizontal bar chart shows, for each airport with cancellations:\n\n- Airport name  \n- Most frequent cancellation reason  \n- Number of cancellations  \n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load Task 6b results\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task6b_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\n\n# Sort by number of cancellations (descending)\ndf = df.sort_values(\"num_cancellations\", ascending=False).head(20)\n\nsns.barplot(\n    data=df,\n    y=\"airport_name\",\n    x=\"num_cancellations\",\n    hue=\"Reason\",\n    dodge=False, \n)\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Cancellations\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Airport\")\nplt.title(\"Most Frequent Cancellation Reason per Airport — December 2018\")\nplt.legend(title=\"Reason\", loc=\"lower right\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.grid(axis=\"x\", alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n---\n\n# 4. Final Takeaways\n\nFrom this analysis of December 2018 flights:\n\n- **Busiest days** show clear traffic concentration, increasing operational pressure.  \n- **Certain airlines** and **airports** consistently face higher delays than others.  \n- **Delay patterns depend on airline–airport combinations**, not just one or the other.  \n- **Cancellations** are driven by a mixture of weather and operational issues, varying significantly by airport.\n\nThese insights can help:\n\n- Travelers make more informed flight choices  \n- Airlines and airports identify operational bottlenecks  \n- Analysts and policymakers better understand seasonal flight patterns  \n\n---\n\n# 5.
