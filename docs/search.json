Early December begins with moderate traffic, followed by a consistent upward trend leading into the holiday period, where flight counts peak around December 20–23. This aligns with pre-Christmas travel surges. After the 24th, flight volume declines sharply, reflecting reduced travel on Christmas Day. Traffic increases again slightly after December 26 as post-holiday travel resumes.\nThese patterns reveal how strongly flight volume correlates with holiday travel behavior. Understanding these fluctuations is essential because high-volume days tend to place more pressure on airports and airlines, increasing the likelihood of delays, congestion, and operational disruptions.\n\n\nWhy this matters: Daily traffic volume is closely tied to operational delays — congestion increases the likelihood of late departures and missed connections.\n\n\nVisualization\n\nLine chart showing:\n\nRaw flight counts by day\n\n3-day moving average overlay\nweekly fluctuation of number of flights\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"./data/miniproject_task7_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\n\n# Convert date column to datetime\ndf2['Flightdate'] = pd.to_datetime(df2['Flightdate'])\n\n# Raw flights per day\nplt.plot(df2['Flightdate'], df2['num_flights'], label=\"Daily Flights\", linewidth=2)\n\n# 3-day moving average\nplt.plot(df2['Flightdate'], df2['avg_num_flights_3day'], \n         label=\"3-Day Moving Average\", linewidth=2.5)\n\nplt.title(\"Daily Flights and 3-Day Moving Average — December 2018\", fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel(\"Date\", fontsize=12)\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Flights\", fontsize=12)\nplt.grid(alpha=0.3)\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

Every airport for which cancellations were recorded listed “Carrier” as its most frequent cancellation category.\nThe highest counts occurred at:\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International — 51 cancellations\n\nBurbank Bob Hope Airport — 34 cancellations\n\nSan Jose Mineta International Airport — 30 cancellations\n\nThese patterns suggest that, during December 2018, airline-level operational disruptions—rather than severe weather or national-system constraints—were the primary drivers of cancelled flights. This aligns with December’s heavy travel season, where tight schedules and high aircraft utilization can amplify delays and operational failures.\n\nKey Insight: Cancellation patterns vary substantially by location, but in December 2018, the overwhelming majority of cancellations were due to Carrier-related factors, highlighting internal airline operational pressures rather than external environmental conditions.\n\n\nVisualization\nA horizontal bar chart shows, for each airport with cancellations:\n\nAirport name\n\nMost frequent cancellation reason\n\nNumber of cancellations\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load Task 6b results\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/miniproject_task6b_Yuxi_Shen_ys1079.csv\")\n\n# Sort by number of cancellations (descending)\ndf = df.sort_values(\"num_cancellations\", ascending=False).head(20)\n\nsns.barplot(\n    data=df,\n    y=\"airport_name\",\n    x=\"num_cancellations\",\n    hue=\"Reason\",\n    dodge=False, \n)\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Cancellations\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Airport\")\nplt.title(\"Most Frequent Cancellation Reason per Airport — December 2018\")\nplt.legend(title=\"Reason\", loc=\"lower right\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.grid(axis=\"x\", alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.show()"
